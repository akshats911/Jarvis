# Jarvis

A python program to make a voice assistant. It takes all inputs in form of voice commands from the user and performs the operartions asked. It's called Jarvis. Why? You should know why!
I'll try to update this to add a few more features. Currently stuck on how to enable it to send an email from voice commands. Feel free to do/suggest changes :)
